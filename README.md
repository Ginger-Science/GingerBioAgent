# Ginger Science BioAgent
### Created in BioAgent hackathon

This agent monitors a Google Drive folder for research papers. When it gets a new paper, it analyzes it and adds it to a knowledge graph. 

## The front end agent, "Vivian Flame" is able to generate hypotheses from this data. 

## Vivian calls plugin-nft-generation on /GENERATE_COLLECTIOn

#### The agent posts to Discord and X. 

## TODO: 
- refine social posting instructions for production
- Refine metadata on plugin so mint functions triggers smoothly

# Instructions

I was able to get the agent running by taking these steps, in this order:

- Clone this repo https://github.com/bio-xyz/BioAgents 
- Setup dependencies https://github.com/bio-xyz/BioAgents/blob/main/SETUP.md 
- Plugin setup https://github.com/bio-xyz/plugin-bioagent 
- Database & Quickstart https://github.com/bio-xyz/BioAgents/blob/main/QUICKSTART.md 

run `nvm use 20` if you get an error, then try again.
